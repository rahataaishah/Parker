        <div class="row align-self-center gy-4">

              <p> Getting a business loan involves factors such as creditworthiness, business plan, and financial statements. Lenders assess the borrower's credit history and stability, review the business plan to understand its purpose and viability, and analyze financial statements to gauge the company's financial health and ability to repay the loan.
              </br></br>
                Lenders also consider industry and market analysis, looking at the industry's potential for growth, market conditions, and the company's competitive advantage. Understanding the market landscape helps lenders evaluate the business's potential for success.
              </br></br>
                Additionally, lenders evaluate the company's cash flow and debt servicing capacity. They assess the stability of cash flow and the company's ability to make regular loan payments. Debt-to-income ratio is analyzed to ensure the business can manage its debt load. Personal guarantees may be required to further secure the lender's interests.
